Women are most likely to feel financially unprepared than men and this is for good reason: According to a recent ING U.S. study, divorced women have, on average, $34,000 less in total retirement savings than divorced men. However, because of the fear that divorced women have about their readiness, many times they rejoin the labor force. This can mean that they can often make larger contributions to their retirement accounts and even earn larger Social Security benefits. Divorced women who have never remarried are also more likely to delay drawing from their retirement funds, which means they will ultimately have larger savings to draw from when they need it.\n",

It was a lot less crowded than Spain, a favorite destination for many French tourists. It was also much closer than Greece.\n",

Though Rove was obviously warming up his throat for the aria of sleaze that is sure to be sung in , his talk of a candidate's health will hopefully open a wider debate -- though not the one Rove wants. Washington is a town fueled by burnout and overwork, and we now know from science the negative impact that approach to life has on decision-making -- which is clearly the main skill a president needs. No one seriously doubts Clinton's brilliance, but the kind of lives we lead govern whether we have access to our wisdom and best judgment. Rove's provocation aside, the public would be well-served if questions about how candidates plan to avoid burnout become a legitimate part of our political conversation.\n",

After five years of a crippling recession, the Greek economy was on the road to recovery for the first time this year with a forecast of percent GDP growth. However the past few months have seen the Greek economy take a turn for the worse: after a disastrous standoff with its international creditors and the imposition of capital controls, the GDP is now expected to drop by percent to percent, and the \"real\" economy has nosedived bringing enormous setbacks to businesses, particularly SME's which are effectively isolated and unable to pay their international suppliers. At a time when the whole notion of entrepreneurship in Greece was being tested, this venture fair was seen as a ray of hope and a chance for business people to meet potential investors from all over the world.\n",

As a young country, we needed our strength for independence and rights and our future, and so therefore there was a void in the basic needs of those that were struggling for life before prosperity. America survives on a history and a remaining belief in volunteerism. To help our fellow man when they cannot help themselves.

As detailed in this blog last month, many Members of Congress support amending the TVPRA so that children from \"non-contiguous\" states would be screened by U.S. border enforcement officials and rapidly removed if they are determined (1) not to have been victims of trafficking, (2) not to credibly fear trafficking or persecution if returned, and (3) able to \"withdraw\" their applications independently. These truncated procedures will ensure that traumatized children will not be able to access an attorney, articulate their claims persuasively, or have their cases reviewed by an immigration judge.\n",

      "Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio has made a huge push to gain millennial supporters this past week, most notably his ad released Tuesday. The ad features a group of millennials, who are all concerned about differing issues facing the country and believe that Sen. Rubio is the answer. The ad coincides with a poll conducted Jan. -7, on behalf of USA Today that questioned adults ages -34 about their voting habits and the issues they find most important. Just percent of the responders said they would vote for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) if the presidential primary election were held today, compared to percent of millennials who said they would vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, don't believe the narrative that all millennials are bleeding heart liberals. In fact, percent of the respondents identified themselves as conservative to some degree, with just percent of them identifying as liberal. When the poll really broke down the issues, many of the millennials did favor a more typically liberal stance on issues like gun control, and their support of the U.S. accepting refugees from Syria. The results show a disconnect between social and fiscal issues among this more tolerant age group. Sen. Rubio is known as \"the Crown Prince\" of the Tea Party movement and despite his minority makeup, he is as conservative as it gets. The pro-life, anti same-sex-marriage, and second amendment supporter may have some trouble garnering millennial support with these extremely conservative views. Though some millennials might not support Sen. Rubio's social views, he is still trying to connect to them through social media. The young senator has been dominating on social media, from retweeting his young volunteers, to blogging on Tumblr, a platform that candidates Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz all have yet to use. This week Rubio appeared on NBC's \"Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" which could be further used to reach the younger demographic. According to Nielsen polls, Fallon raked in million viewers in the -49 age demographic in a single week in . The millennial generation, now the nation's largest, includes those born between and\n",

      "You have to rethink your routine every to weeks. We spoke to a range of fitness experts -- from top-level trainers at national gym chains to trainers with professional athletes and celebrities for clients, and they all said getting variety in the types of cardio and resistance moves you do and how you do them ensures that your workouts are really doing your body good. Even minor tweaks, like doing squats or pushups for a set period of time instead of number of reps, keep your muscles guessing and working in new ways, which improves strength, says Ingrid Nelson, a personal trainer in Washington, D.C., and founder of the ING Group personal training. Variety could also help you do up to percent more reps. Here's why that is, plus more reasons to get creative with your workouts.\n",

      "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- This week, while candidates \"squirmished\" in advance of Iowa, more than global leaders gathered here for the World Economic Forum. The theme was The Fourth Industrial Revolution -- the coming era of automation and smart technology -- and what business can do to help meet the big challenges ahead of us. The dominant refrain was the need for business leaders to put purpose at the center of the definition of business itself. It's a shift, already underway, with the power to not only improve the world but also boost the bottom line. As Unilever CEO Paul Polman put it, \"investing in the common good, investing in the long term, is a better investment than just your short-term self-interest.\" What came through loud and clear this year was a growing realization that companies that chase short-term profits at the expense of social responsibility won't last very long. It's not just a better and more enlightened way forward; it's the only way forward.\n",

      "The quest for religious freedom and equal rights is ongoing, but for years, Hindus have largely been left out of the conversation as victims of religious discrimination and violence. Last week, the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) released its annual human rights report surveying the problems faced by Hindus and other religious minorities across the world. The report's findings not only highlight the persistent issues of discrimination against, marginalization of, and violence towards Hindu religious minorities, they point to a more troubling trend: an outright indifference by many human rights organizations and Western governments towards the persecution of Hindus. While part of the problem might be the continuing conflation between Hindus and India, where they make up roughly percent of the country's billion people, a larger issue might be the simple -- and wrong -- assumption that Hindus don't face the same types of persecution as other religious groups do. For example, while Boko Haram's kidnapping of more than schoolgirls earlier this month drew international media coverage, kidnappings and forced conversions of Hindu, Christian, and Sikh girls in Pakistan happen quite frequently without any mention: Roughly girls a year are kidnapped and converted through coercion. While countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh are routinely considered as primary perpetrators in religious discrimination and violence, other countries with solid international reputations have been almost as egregious in their violations of religious freedom. Take Malaysia, for example. Before the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight and the government's subsequent bungling of the investigation, Malaysia was seen as a key economic ally to the West and a moderate Muslim democracy. Just as recently as April, President Obama praised close ties between both countries. However, Malaysia has had a disturbingly high number of cases in which religious minorities' rights have been infringed upon. Not only are religious groups such as Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus treated as second-class citizens, the Malaysian authorities routinely destroy Hindu temples and have made the process of continuing Hindu traditions highly difficult through the creation of additional red tape. As the New York Times noted, Malaysian president Razak Najib's early overtures to be moderate -- including the inclusion of Hindu leader Waytha Moorthy into his cabinet -- have been reversed due to \"reactionary elements of his party.\" Moreover, the Malaysian religious police, while not as infamous as their counterparts in Saudi Arabia or Iran, have made headlines in recent years. The religious police have acted as enforcers of the country's Sharia courts, which have increasingly made life difficult for non-Muslims, particularly in family disputes. Several years ago, a Hindu woman who was converted to Islam against her will as a child lost her bid to be recognized as a Hindu. Just last year, a Hindu woman, whose husband took their children and had them converted at an Islamic Center, was told by authorities that only a Sharia Court could decide her rights. Other cases involving non-Muslims have also made headlines in the country in recent years, highlighting the extent of Malaysia's deeply entrenched discriminatory policies restricting freedom of religion, family rights, and economic opportunities. As Obama himself noted in April: \"Malaysia won't succeed if non-Muslims don't have opportunity.\"\n",

The British media, for example, in the s and s frequently referred to him as \"Laughing Len.\" Laughing Len turns today; and his music can still invoke great sadness. The first verse of one of the songs on his newest album is as depressing as anything Mr. Cohen wrote in the s or s. \"I saw some people starving. There was murder; there was rape. Their villages were burning.They were trying to escape. I couldn't meet their glances. I was staring at my shoes. It was acid; it was tragic. It was almost like the blues.\"\n",

Despite a proliferation of, and easy access to, firearms in the United States, the chance of an American being murdered by a gun is a whopping times higher than in any other developed country. Every day, on average, another lives are lost to gun violence in the United States. It is a public health and safety crisis by every possible standard.\n",

      "I am constantly told that the best way to tell a story is in -characters. When my mother has a question about how to post a photo on to Facebook, I am her go-to-girl, because I \"grew up with this stuff.\" Last semester, I took an entire class on social media. But while I \"tweet\" and learn about the digital revolution in my communications classes, I have never immersed myself in the technology and digital methods that are supposedly altering how we as humans communicate and function. As a millennial, I have experienced first hand a technological evolution that has transformed our daily lives. But even though I grew up with a touch-screen phone nearly glued to my hand, I never had the opportunity to delve into the more complex technologies and digital platforms that have so heavily altered our engagement with one another. That changed last week when I had the opportunity to travel to the SXSW Interactive conference during my spring break. It was definitely a new experience to engage first-hand with the technologies I only read about, and even meet the innovators behind them. At W2O Group's PreCommerce Summit, I listened to top executives from companies like Google, Twitter, IBM and Dell discuss how these companies have helped shape and adapted to the digital revolution. The director of the Health Data Initiative at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Damon Davis, discussed how analytics are reshaping health services across the nation. VJ Joshi, a former HP executive council member, discussed the future according to nanotechnologies and smart machines. I even got the chance to listen to the Today Show's Al Roker discuss the importance of maintaining your true identity in a world that is becoming increasingly shaped by \"trends.\" The event even offered technology demos, like the interactive demo from MDigital Life, which allowed me to determine my network connections across social mediums on a single platform. As a journalism student determining her future in a world where I receive scoffs and the classic, \"there are still journalism majors out there\" when I tell some people my course of study, I found my attendance at this event to be pretty critical. While the classroom experience is necessary to any education, this event provided me with the opportunity to truly understand the technologies I am so often told are \"defining the future\" and even \"defining our generation.\" While millennials may be a bit iPhone happy, there is still a great deal for us to learn about the digital revolution. Universities across the country are striving to ensure that students begin to grasp what digital influence is all about. As a student ambassador for the Center for Social Commerce at Syracuse University, I've been afforded the opportunity to immerse myself in social commerce, social media, technology, analytics and big data, and the larger influence they play in society. Putting technology into the hands of millennials, and putting them in front of the innovators of the st century at events like SXSW is game changing. There is truly no stopping the next generation of thinkers and doers. Just sit back and watch us.\n",

The writer, a doctor, imagines a dialogue with a patient- Mr. Jones- based on the shifting recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force about prostate cancer screening. Mr. Jones, receiving updated advice from his doctor that differs from the updated advice he received last time, grows predictably exasperated. (In case you are wondering, the current Task Force position on prostate cancer screening is: Grade C. This means there is a close balance between potential benefits and harms, and clinicians should discuss prostate cancer screening with patients, and reach individualized decisions together.)\n",

      "We live in a world that encourages us to spend wastefully, accumulate more than we need, and put off things like retirement savings until were basically retired. Its easy to look around us and see all the things we could be buying to become the person we want to be, and treat fiscal responsibility like the exclusive domain of antisocial dweebs. But in development and running The Financial Diet every day, I have realized that the first concrete steps to becoming the kind of person who is good with money are rather easy and straightforward these are the basic of getting good with money in a year that we have learned in three years of building The Financial Diet, and being on serious financial diets ourselves. . Create a Budget Without a budget, you have no chance of getting control over your money and getting it to do what you want. Sit down with a few months worth of card statements and bills, track exactly what youre doing, and sort everything into a category going forward. . Build an Emergency Fund We recommend that you have three months worth of all living costs saved up in an easily accessible, regular savings account. You can do up to six months worth, but, at least initially, three months is the best balance between doable and providing the necessary security. This emergency fund (and about $1,000 in your checking account for day-to-day use, once bills are paid) are really the only money you should keep in regular bank accounts. The rest of your savings should go to much more useful and valuable things, like retirement (but more on that later). . Do a Credit Card Check-Up Comb through statements and purchases from the last three months, and make sure youre not utilizing more than percent of your available credit (this impacts your credit score), and raise your limits if you can (and if you trust yourself) to grow the gap between what you can use and what you do use you want as much unused credit as possible. Determine if the rewards systems (travel, cash back, etc.) you have are the most valuable to you, and if youre using them to their fullest extent. Last, set up your bills to be paid on your credit card each month, then set up an automated payment from your checking account to your credit cards to pay them in full each month this ensures you maximize the rewards you get with money you were already spending. . Automate What You Can Card payments, bill payments, and savings transfers should all be automatically made from your checking account. This way, you wont tempt yourself to not save, nor will you take a credit score hit by forgetting to pay something. . Know (and Build) Your Credit Score Use a free online service such as CreditKarma to find out what your credit score is and many such services will also tell you how to improve it. Check your score at least twice a year always with soft inquiries, unlike hard credit checks, which happen when you try to get approved for something and set challenges to yourself to see how high you can get it (and keep it). . Plan for Retirement Lay out a basic plan for retirement savings. This may sound daunting, but if your employer offers retirement accounts, you can simply set a meeting with your human resources rep to go over your options. Initially, open at least one retirement account based on your needs (there are seven types of retirement accounts, for different needs). After your emergency fund (three to six months worth of living expenses) is set up, your retirement fund is the first place youre allocating savings. . Run a Career Check-Up Compare your salary against others in your field using sites such as Glassdoor. Ask yourself serious questions about your job fulfillment and performance (Are you happy? Are you working toward something specific? Do you see areas to grow in your current job and at your current place of employment?). Brainstorm ways you could improve and brush up on what you could be doing better from individual tasks to general career development. Set goals for one, five, and ten years down the road in your professional life, and write them down. . Add at Least One Source of Extra Income There are endless side jobs and gigs out there to supplement income, bolster savings, hone new skills, or even make a career transition. Even if you just dedicate a few hours a month to a side job, even one additional stream of income has a huge impact. Whether youre babysitting or tutoring English from bed via Skype or working a full-on part-time job, always have at least one side hustle on the burner. . Treat Yourself Set mini-goals for yourself across a number of areas (think things like savings, career growth, or personal development) and reward yourself when you hit them. Whether its a well-earned massage, cocktail, vacation, or fancy dinner, take time for sensible self-care and treat yourself for the milestones youve hit it will make doing the right thing for yourself most of the time feel manageable, intuitive, and even enjoyable. I promise you that taking the time to think through these steps will set you up with the right skills (and develop that delayed-gratification muscle) to make life for Future You a whole lot easier.\n",

Your unprecedented act of choosing to do all of your official government business on your personal email account and, further, to house monumentally important documents and correspondence on an email server in your home, was un-categorically one of the dumbest decisions ever. You placed our entire national security at risk and seriously breached the trust of every American citizen. The fact that you are now making light of it makes it even more concerning. You and I are contemporaries. We both grew up in the same era - we learned to communicate via email IN ITS EARLIEST DAYS. We both started our career in the law and eventually morphed into other roles - you into leadership roles in politics and myself into executive positions in the tech sector. For both of us, we understood the distinction between a personal email account and a corporate one. Back in the 's when email systems became popular, it was immediately understood that companies would have a need to implement policies requiring their employees to conduct their company business using official company email. We graduated a few years apart from law school. While there, we BOTH learned the importance of this: Adherence to the Rules of Law. They were drilled into us. Then you practiced law- just like I did. In fact, you may recall being the first female partner at the prestigious Rose Law Firm.\n",

In , Timely Publications published Marvel Comics which featured Namor, The Sub-Mariner. Timely Publications would take on the namesake of this series and Namor would go down in history as Marvel's first superhero. Since then, Marvel and DC have become the two dominant companies in the comic book industry, prevailing over all other competitors.

Quinoa is a great source of protein, iron, and fiber, which is why we incorporated it into our first meatless burger. The combination of quinoa and black beans gives this recipe its burger-like texture. The added seasonings create layers of flavor that will wow your taste buds. In fact, all of my kids love these burgers and for me that's a huge accomplishment. Serve these healthy quinoa black bean burgers over greens or on a whole grain bun. Either way, topping them off with sliced avocado and tomato, drizzled with balsamic glaze is a must!\n",

      "Before I had my first child, I was a very sound sleeper. The phone could ring without waking me up. However, from the moment I came home from the hospital with my first baby, all that changed. I now heard every little whimper from the bassinet that was next to our bed. My mothering instincts had seemingly automatically clicked on, and I became totally tuned into my baby's feelings and needs. On the inner level, it was a completely different story. Since my feelings and needs were unimportant to my parents, I had learned to make my own feelings and needs unimportant to me as well. I had learned to tune them out and instead be very tuned into others' feelings and needs. When I finally realized this many years ago, I discovered it was enormously challenging for me to remember to notice my feelings. It was not that I couldn't tell what I was feeling -- it was that I couldn't remember to stay present in my body and mindful of my feelings. I was so used to noticing what everyone else felt and caretaking them that I kept forgetting to notice and care about my own feelings. In fact, I realized that my feelings of fear or anxiety were a trigger for me to care-take someone else rather than care about myself.\n",

During that fifty-year period, the numbers of Americans marrying have sharply decreased and about half of those who do marry get divorced. The social organization of the United States (and of most societies in the West) is still seen as being based on families interlinked through marriage, so concern is understandable. But what truly holds contemporary communities and societies together is not the institution of marriage but the family relationships it used to support--above all, relationships between parents and children. So should shoring up marriage still be our priority? And is it even possible?\n",

In , former British diplomats, all experts on the Middle East, had sent him a letter which stated, inter alia, that they had \"watched with deepening concern\" as Britain followed the U.S. into war in Iraq in . They also criticized Blair's support for the so-called \"Road Map for Peace\" between Israel and Palestine which included retaining Israeli settlements in the West Bank. A delegation of these diplomats was also received by Blair. According to a friend of mine, a retired British ambassador with extensive Middle East experience, Blair was not well-briefed on the historical context of the British involvement in the Middle East in the th century. When one of the ambassadors referred to the role of Gertrude Bell -- one of the architects of modern Iraq -- Blair responded: \"Who was Bell?\" My friend said that the delegation was aghast at the lack of knowledge of a person who was at the helm of British foreign policy making.\n",

      "Wow. Imagine me, a local rabble rouser, being lumped in with the likes of ISIS. I went to Madison, Wisconsin last week to voice my opinion over the Right To Work legislation, not because I'm a member of any union, but as a citizen who feels marginalized, who hates to see The Wisconsin Idea being torn apart -- like, say, a pristine forest by a mining company (lucky for us, Gogebic Taconite pulled up and out -- mining interruptus?) I stood there in the windy cold, on the Capitol steps, over-dressed -- down-filled jacket, mittens and boots -- but I didn't take into account the insulating properties of Iron Workers Local . While I'm not one of those USA! USA! rah-rah types, when said Iron Workers and their brothers and sisters began to sing the National Anthem, I got all verklempt. It was a moment, not unlike going to vote in the last Presidential election, standing in a long line of elderly African-Americans, one woman in particular who talked about how back in the day, she had to guess how many beans were in a jar before she was allowed to vote (no right answer) and who should walk past me? The Rev. Jesse Jackson. Yeah, that was a moment. So was standing on the street listening to a very hoarse-r than usual Bruce Springsteen singing \"This Land Is Your Land\" right before the soon-to-be-re-elected President spoke on election eve. But, this day in Wisconsin was my first real protest. I didn't get involved in the anti-war protests during the Vietnam era because I was only and my father was a cop, a.k.a. The Man, so, yeah... fun times. And for all other things protest-y, when it came to issues that I supported, I pretty much sat on my butt and let other people do my talking, walking and slogan-chanting for me. So, what made me get off my duff this time? Budget. Cuts.\n",

      "A couple of days before Jackie and I left for a trip (we'll be eating sardines in Sicily by the time this appears), we had a few friends over for dinner. I was determined to use the last of the duck confit I'd made last winter, but there wasn't enough to serve it on its own. At the outset, I thought I'd assemble some sort of pie - maybe using puff pastry to form a pithivier-like disc. I'd grind duck meat and pork or chicken (all from the freezer as part of the pre-vacation clear-out) into a stuffing and stud it with chunks of confit. The freezer also held a container of rich duck stock, so sauce-making would be easy.\n",

      "F. Scott Fitzgerald is perhaps the most celebrated graduate of Princeton University. His debut novel, This Side of Paradise (1920), is set at Princeton and is loosely autobiographical of his own undergraduate days there: the association between Fitzgerald and the school began at the start of his literary career, and intensified after his early death in . His widow, Zelda, urged their daughter Scottie and the executor of Scotts estate, Fitzgeralds college friend John Biggs, to sell his papers to Princeton and its library. Zelda even offered to come to Princeton herself to plead the case for this happening to administrators and library staff. In , Scottie donated her fathers immense archive to the university. The connection between Fitzgerald and Princeton is something that even the most casual readers of his fiction know about him.\n",

Each featured individual in this series currently serves as a prominent person in the New York nightlife community or has made important contributions in the past that have sustained long-lasting impacts. e HuffPost Gay Voices believes that it is important and valuable to elevate the work, both today and in the past, of those engaged in the New York nightlife community, especially in an age where queer history seems to be increasingly forgotten. Nightlife not only creates spaces for queers and other marginalized groups to be artistically and authentically celebrated, but the work of those involved in nightlife creates and shapes the future of our culture as a whole. Visit Gay Voices regularly to learn not only about individuals currently making an impact in nightlife, but those whose legacy has previously contributed to the ways we understand queerness, art, identity and human experience today.\n",

I did, however get an interview for a position at a prestigious private high school, as well as a job offer which would have led to overseeing their entire art program in a few years. However, I turned it down since I currently work in a great public school with other full-time art teachers, and it would have involved a complicated relocation.

Last December OUTVETS made LGBT history when the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council (AWVC) voted -4 in favor of allowing this LGBT veterans organization to march in South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade next month. Since when the U.S. Supreme Court voted unanimously to not allow LGBT groups to march via freedom of speech for the AWVC the parade has been boycotted by Massachusetts politicians. Whether other LGBT organization will be permitted to march is doubtful. AWVC's decision to allow OUTVETS to participate was because of OUTVETS nonpolitical agenda and after OUTVETS' historic appearance as the first LGBT group to march in Boston's Veterans Day Parade last November.\n",

But the real answer is in repealing existing legislation -- the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Congress has chosen to immunize from liability (not companies or individuals who engage in life-saving activities or products), but those who make a product designed to injure and kill people. Yes, there are some exceptions, but the rationale for the legislation primarily was that the industry was being sued; the litigation was costing them money, and they didn't like it! No other industry receives such protection. Hospitals, doctors, nurses, and pharmaceutical companies engaged in researching and inventing life-saving medicines receive no such protection. All are subjected to tort laws and lawsuits.\n",

He asks the crocodile for a lift across the water to the other side. At first, the crocodile refuses, he tells the scorpion that he doesn't trust him, that he fears the scorpion might sting him. The scorpion replies that if he stung the crocodile they would both drown, and that would make no sense. The crocodile acknowledges that and agrees to carry him over on his back. When they reach the middle of the waterway, the crocodile feels the sting and as he flounders in the waves says; \"Now we'll both die, why did you do this?\" The scorpion replies, \"This is the Middle East.\"\n",

      "Before my husband and I left for a writing vacation in Spain, we had dinner with Ron Carlson and went over our summer reading lists. We discussed Lila by Marilyn Robinson, but I couldn't imagine either man reading it. My friend Jim Tilley, sure, but Jim's an animal, he'll read any smart book, but Ron and Mark, I was pretty sure wouldn't make it through Lila which is very much a \"woman's book\". I read Elena Ferrante's book, My Brilliant Friend the first week of the trip. It was fun, but I cannot imagine a man reading it. Like Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood, it gives us a world of girls. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See gives us that girl world in China. Women love these stories.\n",

      "You have to feel just a bit of empathy for Brian Williams. He lied, misrepresented the facts, embellished his stories and surely we can't rely on him as the most trusted name in news anymore - but then, did we really ever believe that line? And, come on - how many of us can honestly say we have NEVER lied, or embellished the facts just a little? Maybe we did so to save face, perhaps we got caught up in a story that became too difficult to extradite ourselves from, or maybe we told a little white lie to make someone feel better. Whatever the case, Brian Williams' downfall is symptomatic of our culture. No doubt Williams felt compelled to spiff up his newscasts. It IS difficult to compete with really important breaking news stories like celebrities in car accidents along the Malibu coast (Bruce Jenner), snow in the Northeast during the month of February (this is news?), or with the recent trend where morning news anchors cast themselves as media icons, evidenced by the estimated million dollar super bowl ad of the Today show cast. Does anyone really care? We think Brian's demise is an example of trying to maintain relevancy in a world that is changing. Social media and the Internet have essentially eliminated the relevancy of the evening newscast, and the emergence of new forms of investigative journalism by comedians turned social activists (Jon Stewart) and other journalists (John Oliver) have usurped the importance of evening broadcasts. But we think there is a bit more to this. Look around - we are bombarded by images and tweets of celebrities that are known for the size of their derrieres, their baby bumps, what they wear and the depth of their plunging necklines. What's a newscaster to do? And don't even get us started on Tweets, Facebook, and Selfies. Don't get us wrong. We love photos of beautifully prepared food, exquisite holidays, and those that document the accolades of yourself, family and your friends. We admit, we often share, but within limits. We are delighted there are so many people that use - but enough already! The world is turning into a perpetual Christmas letter update about everyone's wonderful life, and we are tired of it. We live in a culture where there is a strong need to be known, to be special, and to stand out - and this has some serious implications in education. Think about this encounter Jane had with three college students recently. In an informal setting the students were asked a simple question - what is your major? Student : \"I'm a double major in Economics and Business and studied in Japan.\" Student : \"Psychology and Philosophy.\" Student : \"I'm the underachiever in the group - I am just majoring in English, but I love it.\" This student went on to discuss the impact of a class in medieval literature.\n",

      "Raghida Dergham The US President-elect Donald Trump has caused different kinds of reactions so far: an international keenness to follow up news of his decisions and cabinet appointments, an optimistic surge in the New York stock markets, and deep apprehension among a segment of Americans and others regarding the possibility of the US turning its back on its values, principles, and constitution towards becoming more racist, exclusionary, and sectarian. Clearly, this controversial man can never be a source of boredom. He is enjoying the game of power and taking pleasure in hiding his cards, leaving the whole world in a state of anxious suspense. Trump and his team are however certain that they cannot re-invent the presidency, but must work with the traditional pillars of the Washington establishment during the transition, bearing in mind that Trump's campaign was essentially against this same establishment. President-elect Trump's tenor has changed from that of candidate Trump on many levels, not least as he backtracked from his threat to prosecute his rival Hillary Clinton he had made on the campaign trail. This does not apply to all his electoral promises. For example, he had stated his intention to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), proposed by the outgoing President Barack Obama to strengthen US influence in Asia as part of his pivot to the continent away from the Middle East. With regard to what he may have in mind vis--vis Russia and its strategic adventures in Syria or Ukraine, or vis--vis Iran and its expansionism in the Arab region especially Syria, his approach will most likely be a combination of sustaining US long-term strategic interests, and a personal touch Trump wants to characterize his term with. Realism will force the president-elect to think twice, however, before he decides to begin his tenure with a public partnership with powers that the US' Western allies accuse of committing war crimes under the pretext of fighting ISIS in their bid to keep the regime of Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria. No doubt, Trump will continue Obama's current efforts in Mosul and Raqqa to defeat ISIS and their ilk. Perhaps the battle for Mosul will be concluded before Trump's inauguration, with the goal of denying territory to the ISIS caliphate state. The US was supposed to handle ISIS in Iraq while Russia would handle ISIS in Syria. But what happened was that Russia changed the mission in Syria from tackling ISIS to tackling moderate Syrian rebels, who were fighting both ISIS and the Syrian regime. Russia and Iran, Assad's allies, found an opportunity to shore up Assad's regime by first focusing on the moderate opposition. They wagered that Barack Obama would not move to stop their efforts on the ground or to provide advanced weaponry to the rebels, or even seriously protest the appalling violations committed by the pro-regime alliance in Syria including committing war crimes such as targeting hospitals. Donald Trump will inherit from Barack Obama both a moral and a humanitarian crisis in Syria. If the war had ended, Trump would not have had to deal with Obama's actions, or rather, inactions. But the war rages on, and the violations are tallying up. Trump will have to either continue Obama's policies, make some cosmetic changes, or pursue a wholly different policy. His statements on the campaign trail suggested that Trump's absolute priority will be to defeat ISIS, for which goal he is willing to partner up with Putin, Assad, and even international fugitive Qassem Soleimani, commander of the IRGC' Qods Force, if the situation on the ground requires it. Yet his attitudes on the Islamic Republic of Iran indicate that he would not allow Tehran to go out of bounds, whether in terms of the nuclear program or its regional dominance, and that he perceives Iran as a sponsor of state terror. If Donald Trump fulfills his electoral promises and joins the Russia-Syria-Iran axis, he would be partnering up with powers accused of war crimes in Syria, and also implicating the US as a party to the civil war in Syria alongside Bashar al-Assad. Furthermore, he would be legitimizing Hezbollah and Iran-sponsored Shiite militias created to fight in Syria, and he would become a de-facto ally of Iran even as it is fighting sectarian battles. Additionally, he would be antagonizing Turkey and other NATO allies that radically question Russia's intentions in Syria, and finally, would be inaugurating his term with the stain of disregarding the principle of accountability for war crimes, cementing the US' reputation as a country that deliberately abandoned its moral responsibility vis--vis civilians. Iran could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's promises on Syria if fulfilled. Iran would escape accountability thanks to its partnership with the US on the ground in the war on ISIS. This is despite the fact that the elimination of ISIS is not an Iranian project, but an international project with Sunni partnership before it was an Iranian partnership. Indeed, ISIS had managed to impose itself in Iraq following Iranian violations in that country, where Shiites monopolized power and excluded Sunnis. Iran was in other words a key cause of the rise of ISIS, and is determined to crush it because removing the caliphate state between Iraq and Syria would serve the project for the Shiite crescent linking Iran to Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. General David Petraeus knows very well the need to partner up with Sunnis to defeat ISIS, having been the architect of partnering with Sunnis in Iraq to defeat al-Qaeda previously. Some believe that this had poured oil on the Sunni-Shiite sectarian fire and helped create a climate that allowed the emergence of ISIS. But even if this were true, the lesson is to remain vigilant and be alert to the implications of the perception that the US is alternating partnership between Sunnis and Shiites. Petraeus believes the US has a different option other than the one Trump had suggested, one that strikes at the heart of US-Russian, US-Iranian, and US-Syrian relations. His view is that caving in to Putin, Assad, or Soleimani would be extremely costly for US strategic interests, and that the time has come to admit that talking about political solutions in Syria is lip service while military decision is the only game in town in Syria. Accordingly, Petraeus starts off by declaring that there is no need whatsoever for a US ground intervention in Syria, and does not fear a Russian-American showdown there. He suggests instead bombing Syria airbases to stop barrel bombings, while notifying Russia that any bid to interfere in this would lead to a confrontation. Petraeus is confident a clear US warning will force Putin to back down. Petraeus believes the time has come to revive the role of the US as a superpower ready to act based on its interests and principles, which require now changing the military balance of power in Syria, arming the moderate rebels, and activating the international coalition with Russian participation to defeat ISIS and similar groups in Syria and Iraq. It was the removal of the military option from the table that led to America's humiliation and undermined its prestige as a superpower. At least, this is what many Republicans that Trump is seeking to coopt believe. Trump himself agrees with this principle, despite being unenthusiastic for a military confrontation with Russia or others. He believes the US must restore its greatness and exceptionalism. The question therefore is how President Donald Trump would be able to combine his isolationist tendencies with the quest to restore American prestige and deterrence as he said he intended to do. The clear hostility by some of the Trump administration appointees and would-be-appointees to Iran and their opposition to the nuclear deal must not be interpreted by the Gulf countries as something that will automatically translate into pressure on Iran's regional policy, in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. Any deep evaluation of how to influence US policy requires steering clear of rash conclusions as well as complacency. This period of time is crucial for influencing the policies of the coming administration in the Middle East. The Gulf summit will convene in Bahrain in two weeks, marking an exceptional opportunity to hone the message to be sent to the Trump administration, beyond implicitly expressing welcome of the departure of Obama's administration or protesting the Islamophobic attitudes of Trump or his national security advisor. There is no need to welcome what can be interpreted as firmness with Iran, and there is no need to condition Gulf-American partnership in Syria and against terror on the departure of Assad. Declaring total war on ISIS and similar groups serves the Gulf interest, but there is a need to declare a comprehensive strategy on a serious partnership with regard to this clear priority for the Trump administration, and to building a new paradigm in the relationship between the US and the GCC. Egypt might sense that it is in a better position than others to forge a special relationship with the president-elect. Egypt's leader Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi was among the first to call Trump to congratulate him, even before the British prime minister. Egypt could consider that the appeasement of the kind sought by Trump with Putin would serve its own interest, in light of its strong ties to Moscow. Egypt might feel reassured by Obama's departure, as it considers him one of the key backers of the Muslim Brotherhood's rise to power, and equally reassured by Trump's hostility to radical Islamism that it considers its enemy. Here too, however, Egypt must be prudent and refrain from misinterpreting Trump's willingness to work with Assad against radical Islamism as a gateway to improving US-Egyptian partnership. It would be instead wiser for Egypt to seek a reformulation of US-Egyptian relations as a separate strategy. It would be worthwhile for the Arab countries not to focus all their efforts on the newcomer in Washington. There are other newcomers, for example the new UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who will take over in early January. Guterres is a pragmatist who is interested in the Arab region and Syria, and is an expert on refugee issues. This week, Guterres held an informal session with the UN Security Council members. During the session, he made interesting remarks on Syria, quoted by one of the ambassadors in attendance. He told them frankly that Syria was the reason he sought the post, because he believed the bloodletting there must stop. There are important implications for these remarks, and the Arab strategy must effectively build on their spirit. Translated by Karim Traboulsi\n",

A few months earlier, we had backpacked around Southeast Asia for about two months with no plans but a ticket into Saigon and a ticket out of Bangkok or so days later. It was one of the best times in my life, and seemed even more attractive in the fluorescent light of our respective offices. It became a fairly common practice every week to, over the course of our gchat conversations, calculate how long we could spend on a little island in Thailand with the money that we had at the time. With the money I had, I could have spent six months on Koh Lanta, a tiny island in the Andaman Sea, drinking coconut shakes and riding mopeds through the rainforest. But I didn't.\n",

      "Latino families are an important part of California's economy, contributing to our social growth and vitality. Unfortunately, Latinos often live with poor air quality and other forms of environmental contamination in their communities. We started the California Latino Environmental Advocacy Network (CLEAN) to have a seat at the table and to be part of the conversation regarding environmental issues. I have been involved in social justice issues for over two decades now. CLEAN is here to provide a voice and to advocate for the community members who are often most impacted by environmental pollution. The most negatively impacted community by environmental pollution is the Latino community, especially in areas such as Southeast Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, and South Los Angeles. The recent explosion at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance is a reminder that we must do everything in our power to safeguard our air, water, and natural resources. We have an opportunity to encourage our policymakers to make the best decisions for our region. We started CLEAN since we felt that the Latino community is not well represented in environmental protection issues. We are the first Latino founded and led, statewide, environmental non-profit organization. As we elect more Latino lawmakers and our political influence in California grows, we must encourage our lawmakers to advocate strongly for our environmental health. We deserve clean air, clean water, and open space for our families, seniors, and children. We do not have to choose between jobs and healthy air quality in our region. In fact, California is making some strides for a healthier environment and more green jobs need to be created. The state's economic growth is again leading the nation, and we have the world's seventh largest economy. California has made this economic rebound while being a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Senate Bill was passed to rectify underinvestment in underserved areas. This legislation is meant to ensure funds from California's landmark greenhouse reduction bill (AB ) would go to communities that cannot afford to invest in low carbon solutions like mass transit, bike lanes, energy efficiency initiatives, and local food networks. This is a huge opportunity for our community to access funds that will result in cleaner air, greener transportation, and a better environment for our families. This progress on the environment and economy is welcome. But, Latino communities still face huge environmental challenges that require leadership and diligence. For example, the Exide battery plant in Vernon, for over three decades, released lead dust into the air and land, affecting the health and quality of life for many families in the predominantly Latino region. Many people have died due to cancer in Southeast Los Angeles. Recently, Exide plant was denied permission to resume lead smelting in Vernon last year. These are the kinds of environmental challenges we must address in the future in a more timely manner, since yes, protecting our environment is an issue of life or death. Many Latino neighborhoods continue to be disproportionately affected by poor air quality. Here in L.A. County, we are in the top quarter of the state that is adversely impacted by air pollution. We have to build coalitions to work with our Latino leaders in the state capitol to stand up for communities that need clean air, communities that need a strong voice, and communities that are fighting for a healthy environment. I encourage Latino legislators like Assemblymembers Cristina Garcia, Roger Hernandez, and Ian Calderon to support new calls by state leaders to reduce California's greenhouse gases to percent below the level by . They should insure that such bills benefit the most impacted communities first. This way we can continue California's climate progress by establishing carbon reduction goals for . Let's continue to make our environment healthier, cleaner and more prosperous for families in our region.\n",

      "There are three hopes in many circles about the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and all track back to one thing: will there be anything to come out of it to provide grounds for bringing impeachment charges against ? The first is that Comey can back up his now famed memo in which he asserts Trump demanded that he stand down from investigations into then National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and the Russia meddling/election connection. The second tracks back to the first hope. Thats that Comey has added documents or even a tape in which Trump actually orders him to back off. The third is that Comey can provide just enough drama in his testimony to make it good media theater.\n",

      "Politicians lie! I know it, you know it, we all know it! Call Bullshit is the first interactive show where you can call politicians out on all their bullshit in a funny and engaging way. Think Trump's lying when he says he funded his own campaign? Call Bullshit! Tired of Christie trying to pull the wool over your eyes? Call Bullshit! Sounds like Ben Carson is making up numbers on the spot? Hit the button, call them out on their bullshit, and learn the facts behind all their bold-faced lies. A few weeks ago, my producing partner Jeremy Chilnick and I were talking with our friends at Interlude, a media technology company here in the city. We were dying to collaborate in a way that would make some noise and combine Interlude's interactive technology with the storytelling style of Warrior Poets. We knew our interests and passions were aligned, we were just trying to pick the right project to come out of the gate with. Then we saw the last Republican debate and all the blatant lies coming out of everyone's mouths when it hit us - let's find a way to call bullshit on these people in as close to real time as possible! Call Bullshit is an entertaining way to blow off steam after actually watching those debates, but doing it in a way that's infinitely more engaging, way more than just venting over drinks or around the office water cooler. You watch those debates, and save for a few exceptions, the moderators aren't calling them out on things in real time. Call Bullshit gives you the power to do it yourself!\n",

The film reunites their all-star cast of iconic characters to explore the acceptance, conflict and bigotry following the Supreme Court Marriage Equality Decision. The ensemble cast of actors is led by Bonnie Bedelia (Parenthood), Caroline Rhea (Sabrina, the Teenage Witch), Dale Dickey (Independent Spirit Award winner Winters Bone), Leslie Jordan (Emmy winner Will & Grace) with cast members from the original Sordid Lives film Newell Alexander (August: Osage County), Rosemary Alexander, Kirk Geiger, Sarah Hunley, Lorna Scott (Wanted) and Ann Walker. New additions Levi Kreis (Tony winner Million Dollar Quartet), Carole Cook (Sixteen Candles), Alec Mapa (Ugly Betty), Aleks Paunovic (Van Helsing), Katherine Bailess (Hit The Floor) and a cameo from Whoopi Goldberg. After premiering at the Palm Springs Film Festival the film went on to play in cities across the U.S. in theatrical runs and festival screenings with sold-out events with another fifteen markets scheduled. A Very Sordid Wedding will continue to travel around the country until its DVD release on October th. I talked to Emerson about the significance of his new film especially after the events in Charlottesville, Virginia and his spin on our LGBTQ issues.\n",

Many national restaurants have nutrition information listed alongside their items on their website, and when you figure out what you want to order beforehand, you have a better chance of choosing something delicious that fits into your healthy eating goals.

And dishes that may seem more decadent, like steaks and roast chicken, are actually a smarter choice when it comes to portion size, calorie count and nutrition.\n",

As Chris Rock tweeted, \"This one was on film\" -- a nod to the grand jury in Ferguson declining to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown just a week earlier. And on Thursday, the Justice Department released a damning report about a seemingly out-of-control police force in Cleveland (where a police officer recently killed Tamir Rice, a -year-old holding a pellet gun). In response to all this, largely peaceful protests have broken out across America. The question isn't just how to police our police. The problem is how to fix a broken justice system that has, for obvious reasons, lost the trust of much of our country. The first step is translating people's anger into political action to reassert accountability and put justice back into the justice system.\n",

Duke is beautiful in the spring, and it was beautiful today. The sky was the pale crystal of early morning despite it being three in the afternoon, and the sun was a cool, distant yellow. And I sat there, on a worn wooden bench that was warm beneath my skin, and I breathed and I thought about what these past few days have brought.\n",

      "I can clearly recall sitting in my kindergarten class, learning about goal setting, what that meant, how to set them, and why it was a great habit to get into. Being the exceptional student that I was (I'm being facetious but not really), I listened, I learned, I implemented, and never thought twice about the act of goal setting after that. It was a habit that I learned to practice and master as the years went by both in and out of school. Today, post college, I continue to set goals. In fact, I set yearly goals or what most of us call New Year's Resolutions, I set quarterly goals for my business, I create weekly goals and even daily goals, what many of us call to-do lists. I love them really, and they help keep me grounded, focused and moving in the direction I know I want to go in. Once I've achieved a goal, it also gives me a great sense of motivation and accomplishment.\n",

As children their characters had to flee their homeland, walking thousands of miles to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. The dangerous African terrain is gorgeously shot under Philippe Falardeau's fine direction. After years, the orphans come to the United States, among the last to make that journey before /11 closed down those doors and possibilities for emigration. Once here, the boys need to find jobs, and learn our ways one electric light switch at a time, and that's where Reese Witherspoon comes in to help with the transition. The Good Lie, a seeming oxymoron, takes its title from a dilemma solved by Huck Finn in saving Jim in Mark Twain's classic, as Mamere (Oceng) learns from a literature class to adapt to American culture. The Good Lie speaks to a brave, resonant heroic act that reveals his character's essential decency.\n",

      "Pale GumsWhat it could mean: You might want to order up a juicy burger or a giant spinach salad. When your body isnt producing enough red blood cells, you could be looking at anemia, says John Moore, DDS, of Cosmetic Dental Associates in San Antonio. Gums should be nice and pink and being deficient in nutrients like iron or B12 could be a culprit, and you may also notice other symptoms like weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Talk with your doctor. Swollen GumsWhat it could mean: Your medications may be to blame. Dentists notice that certain Rxs, like those for epilepsy, seizure and high blood pressure, can make gums puffy, and therefore, bleed during brushing, says Mazen Natour, DMD, MScD, NYC-based prosthodontist. A visit with your dentist to review a list of your meds could help to explain the bleeding. Then, see your doctor. In some cases, your physician may be able to suggest an alternative medication. If thats not possible, your best option is to redouble your commitment to brushing and flossingeven if the issue is meds related, its still a gum problem so practicing good oral care is importantand schedule regular appointments with your dentist, he says. Red, Sore GumsWhat it could mean: Even though you brush and floss daily, you may still have gums that are red, swollen or bleed easilyand they may not heal as well. In people with [type ] diabetes, the gums cant fight for themselves, says Natour. The saliva that bathes the teeth is high in glucose, which feeds the bacteria in their teeth. In this case, your dentist may send you to your doctor for a physical exam and blood tests. White Spots on Your GumsWhat it could mean: During a regular check-up, your dentist is on the lookout for any white or red lesions around and inside your mouth. If we see a patch or lump of tissue that clearly doesnt belong there, we immediately think about the possibility of oral cancers, says Moore. For perspective, a white spot by itself doesnt indicate an oral cancer, and it can be from other causes like an allergic reaction or a canker sore, says Natour. But if oral cancer is suspected (other symptoms include difficulty chewing or swallowing, ear pain and hoarseness), your dentist or doctor will order a biopsy. If you notice a spot that doesnt go away in two weeks, call your dentist for an exam. Receding GumsWhat it could mean: Youd never think that your teeth and breasts were linked, but there is, in fact, a twofold issue. With only percent of working-age adults visiting the dentist regularly, that means many are missing out on the best way to prevent periodontal disease (in which bacteria breaks down gum tissue and bones). Whats more: If you dont know you have periodontal diseaseand heres the surprising connectionyou also wont know that youre at an increased risk for breast cancer. A study found that having periodontal disease can raise your risk for breast cancer by percent. (For former smokers, their odds went up percent.) Researchers say that the chronic inflammation caused by oral disease may be one factor driving cancer growth. You may notice your gums have formed pockets, which allows for infection, and your teeth may loosen. Consider this your reminder to schedule your next dental exam, which is essential for preventing future problems.\n",

      "Child abuse is among the most difficult subjects imaginable to discuss. Just thinking about the abuse, maltreatment or neglect of children too young or too powerless to defend themselves can be emotionally wrenching. Older youth can become deeply troubled by the recognition that they were abandoned or maltreated simply because of who they are. The reality of child abuse forces us to confront the disturbing notion that the very adults charged with the safety and care of their children have done just the opposite. This is a subject -- however uncomfortable -- that demands our attention. Nationwide in there were nearly confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect. With this many children being bruised and scarred by abuse and neglect, whether physical, emotional or sexual, it is immoral and unacceptable to merely avert our eyes.\n",
